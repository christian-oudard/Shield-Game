design for a turn-based puzzle game

prior work
- sokoban
	- von neumann grid 
	- boxes to push around
	- can push only one box in a row
	- goal is to arrange blocks in a certain way
- mouse, cheese, cats, and blocks ?
	- moore grid
	- can push as many blocks as you want
	- cats chase you, and when they are constrained to one square, they turn into cheese
- drod
	- moore grid
	- primary mechanic is a large sword which is swung around to 8 directions
	- many kinds of enemies
	- win when all enemies in room are dead
	- hit enemies with sword to kill them
	- myriad other mechanics, floor types, switches, doors, goo, bombs, etc
	- levels are contiguous, and rooms affect each other
- laser tank
	- von neumann grid
	- primary mechanic is shooting a laser and having it bounce off of mirrors
	- enemy tanks shoot you
	- blocks which can be pushed with a laser
	- water which turns into land when a block is pushed in
	- win by getting to the flag
- chip's challenge
	- von neumann grid
	- not turn based, but movement is discrete on squares
	- collect all chips to unlock final door and win level
	- many enemies that kill on contact, no way to kill enemies
	- floor types
		- ice makes you slide, with redirector tiles
		- fire kills you
		- force floors push you in a direction
		- water is unpassable unless you push a block into it
		- boots to bypass every floor type
- kwirk
	- von neumann
	- polyominoes to push around
	- when polys fall in a pit, they make a floor
	- turnstile blocks, have a pivot, hero can push them around
	- multiple heroes, can switch between them
	- win by getting to finish door
- kickle cubicle
	- breath on enemies to turn them into ice blocks
	- ice blocks can be kicked around, they slide until they hit something
	- when a block falls in water, it becomes a floor
	- can make and destroy "posts" at will, whese stop a sliding block and protect from enemies
	- various other puzzle elements
		- enemies that kick blocks too
		- springs that bounce a block back
		- floors where enemies can't go
		- floors where you can't go, but blocks can
		- hammers that swing around and hit a block a different direction
	- win by collecting all the bags
- lolo
	- not turn based
    - sort-of von neumann, but half-spaces in between too
	- many enemies that kill on contact
	- turrets which kill as soon as they have orthogonal line of sight
	- hero can turn enemies into eggs
	- crates to push around, and block turrets


	- winning a level
		- 

why do we want blocks?
- hold down floorplate switches
- cross water
- block enemies


not terribly original ideas

floating blocks:
- block can float but hero may not pass
- must use other means to push block across

heavy versus light block:
- can push as many light blocks in a row as you want
- only one heavy block at a time

enemy horde:
- better coordinated than drod-style enemies
- leave fewer gaps

heavy, dumb enemy:
- can't be pushed or killed, but will walk into hazards

slow enemy:
- takes 2 turns to walk one square

fast enemy or projectile:
- goes 2 or 3 squares per turn

original ideas

sword based:
- squishy block
	- the block cannot be pushed normally, with your body
	- when you stab it, your sword sticks in it
	- moving any way besides backward brings the block with you
	- backward widthraws the sword
	- turning your sword brings the block along
- crumbly block
	- when pushed by your body, it works normally
	- when touched with your sword, it breaks

turn-based ice:
- when standing on ice, you continue moving the same direction you went last time
	- all movement commands, therefore, don't work
- since you slide automatically, you can do other things while sliding you normally couldn't do while moving
- user needs some indication of whether you are sliding
- hitting something while sliding transfers your momentum


turn-based conveyor / force floor:
- forces movement in a particular direction, otherwise similar to ice

shield:
- moore neighborhood
- covers 3 sides (of 8)
- can be turned 8 ways
- protects from enemies
- blocks projectiles
- used to push blocks and enemies around

- spiky block
	- too sharp to push with body
	- must push with shield
- deflect projectiles
	- if projectiles hit shield at a diagonal, they bounce off

dances:
- a particular movement sequence does something
- examples:
	- move back, then forward, which shoots a fireball
	- make a diamond around a square, and something appears


general properties
- self-contained puzzles
- fully deterministic
- user-graspable determinism

sharing levels
- have good integrated level editing tools
- ability to authenticate that a level is solvable, but not reveal the solution
	- have a level sharing website which tracks best solutions
	- upload solutions from inside the game
		- use base64 as encoding
	- have top rated levels

carefully choosing ideas that interact well...

in: 
shield
blocks
enemies

maybe:
ice
turrets
reflecting
water, blocks fill water into land

no:
sword. drod has already done it so well
a way to kill enemies directly
