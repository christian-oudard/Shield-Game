refactoring:
- dir_vec is a stupid name
- get_command is a mess
- load_level is a mess
- review of shield code and refactoring
- refactor block sinking into water collide_terrain() code, reduce duplication

features:
- effects
	- color
	- show when a dead-key command is pending
	- pause momentarily after your move before enemies move
- graphics
	- tile based
	- polyomino effects
	- rounded corners for walls, to show that you may move through diagonally tight spaces
	- motion between states

structure
- polyomino to have start_move and end_move?
- use set_solid() and set_invisible(), with collision checking?

bugs:
- hero can finish level if next to goal even if he can't legally move onto goal
