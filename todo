levels:

to test:
1- undo features
3- test that all the levels in the game can be solved
    - have a solution code like (mne, mw, ssw, me)
	- requires good tests on undo features first
- pushing a block with the shield
- polyomino blocks
- spikes
- pushing blocks into water
	- heavy blocks into water
	- pushing polyomino blocks into water

housekeeping:
- use real python logging, not crappy custom log
- python 3? 2to3? 3to2?

features:
2- record level demo
4- continuity
- gameplay
	- should you be able to push multiple heavy blocks with your shield? maybe no?
- effects
	- color
	- show when a dead-key command is pending
	- pause momentarily after your move before enemies move
- graphics
	- tile based
	- polyomino effects
	- rounded corners for walls, to show that you may move through diagonally tight spaces
	- motion between states

style:
- make it an umbrella

bugs:
- require a level to have a goal
- spaces interior to level are inaccessible, but show the same as floor
- fix n**2 behavior in polyominos (1 move -> 9 trigger test -> 81 trigger action)
	- reduce duplication between polyomino logic and entity logic
- bump display when opening shield is usually incomplete
- display not showing borders correctly?

notes:
