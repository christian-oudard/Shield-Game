todo:
- level design

to test:
- using the shield
	2 - try to open up the shield when you're  blocked
- pushing a block
- pushing several blocks in a line
- pushing a block with the shield
- undo features
- test that all the levels in the game can be solved
    - have a solution code like (mne, mw, ssw, me)

housekeeping:
- use real python logging, not crappy custom log
- python 3? 2to3? 3to2?

features:
- gameplay
	- blocks that don't push in a line, they are too heavy
	- blocks that slide all the way away from you til they hit something
		- maybe they carom and transfer momentum when they hit another block?
		- do they slide together in groups?
- effects
	- color
	- show when a dead-key command is pending
	- pause momentarily after your move before enemies move
- graphics
	- tile based
	- polyomino effects
	- rounded corners for walls, to show that you may move through diagonally tight spaces
	- motion between states

style:
- make it an umbrella

bugs:
- fix n**2 behavior in polyominos (1 move -> 9 trigger test -> 81 trigger action)
- bump display when opening shield is usually incomplete
- display not showing borders correctly?
