todo:
- level design

to test:
- info squares in level loading
- undo features

housekeeping:
- rename variable "type" to "cmd_type" in world.py
- use dict.get where appropriate, instead of doing exception handling
- use real python logging, not crappy custom log
- python 3? 2to3? 3to2?

features:
- effects
	- color
	- show when a dead-key command is pending
	- pause momentarily after your move before enemies move
- graphics
	- tile based
	- polyomino effects
	- rounded corners for walls, to show that you may move through diagonally tight spaces
	- motion between states

bugs:
- fix n**2 behavior in polyominos (1 move -> 9 trigger test -> 81 trigger action)
- bump display when opening shield is usually incomplete
